# TheGym
A template repo for the backend of a web application that will grow as I have time. 

Libraries, frameworks, and databases used: .Net Core 6 rc1, EF core, postgres, npgSql, Automapper, and Newtonsoft.
Patterns used: Unit of work and Repositories, Clean(or layered) Architecture, and a Generic Controller. 

Todo:
- Add fluent validation
- Add Logging with Serilog
- Create new template that builds a docker image of the application
- Add filter to check modelstate validation
- Maybe Create new tamplate with Authorization and Authentication?
